    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The food options and responsibilities to
      consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficient then they have been in the past.Online menus
       with photographs of meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingrediants help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices.Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be
       provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices
       and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can 
       eliminate all the fuss of money handling.Making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike.
       Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

  <h4>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h4>

  <p class="list-group-item col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Implemented Online Attendance Management System:
    This informs parents about their child's/children's activities in the school, instantly.Once a student reaches the school, the parents will be
   informed about the status via text messages. This helps schools keep a record of the students absenteeism.Students can mark the attendance by
   logging in, and this is stored in a database, which can later be checked by the Admin.The tracker has so much potential that it can identify which
   students are irregular to their classes and not ready to establish connectivity with the actual concepts of their curriculum's subjects.As soon as you enter
   a student's Enrollment to their classes and not ready to establish connectivity with actual concepts of their curriculum's subjects.As soo as you enter
   tracker is supported by cloud capabilities. Even the security offered can be so robust and powerful that those students who always fool their deans are caught in a 
   shorter span just after the admin enters login details into this tracker. All this will improve accuracy and transparency in any of the educational institutions as 
   students and their parents are pre-informed about the real-time status of leave requests and absenteeism in a confidential manner and at reducted costs.
